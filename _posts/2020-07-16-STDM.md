    1. preprocessing to correct noise, errors, and missing data and exploratory space-time analysis to understand the underlying spatiotemporal distributions.
    2. an appropriate spatiotemporal data mining algorithm is selected to run on the preprocessed data, and produce output patterns. 
        - Common output pattern families include spatiotemporal outliers, associations and tele-couplings, predictive models, partitions and summarization, hotspots, as well as change patterns. Spatiotemporal data mining algorithms often have statistical foundations and integrate scalable computational techniques. 
        - Output patterns are post-processed and then interpreted by domain scientists to find novel insights and refine data mining algorithms when needed.
